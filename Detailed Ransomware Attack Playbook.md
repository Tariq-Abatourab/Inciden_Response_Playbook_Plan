# Incident Response Playbook Plan
This playbook will cover the following phases of incident response:

- Preparation: Steps to prepare for potential incidents.

- Detection and Analysis: How to detect and analyze the incident.

- Containment: Steps to contain the incident and prevent further damage.

- Eradication: How to eliminate the root cause of the incident.

- Recovery: Steps to restore normal operations.

### Post-Incident Activity: Lessons learned and improvements.

## Step 1: Define the Hypothetical Scenario

Let’s assume the following scenario:

- Attack Type: Ransomware attack.

- Target: A small business network.

- Impact: Critical files encrypted, systems offline, and ransom demand.

## Step 2: Create the Incident Response Playbook

Here’s the detailed playbook for the ransomware attack:

#### 1. Preparation
##### * Team Roles and Responsibilities:

1. Incident Manager: Oversees the response process.

2. IT Team: Handles technical containment and recovery.

3. Legal Team: Advises on compliance and legal implications.

4. PR Team: Manages communication with stakeholders.

##### * Tools and Resources:

1. Antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

2. Backup systems and disaster recovery plans.

3. Contact list for law enforcement and cybersecurity experts.

##### * Training and Drills:

1. Conduct regular incident response drills.

2. Train employees on ransomware awareness.

#### 2. Detection and Analysis
##### * Detection:

1. Monitor for unusual activity (e.g., file encryption, ransom notes).

2. Use IDS and antivirus software to detect ransomware.

##### * Analysis:

1. Identify the ransomware variant (e.g., WannaCry, LockBit).

2. Determine the scope of the attack (e.g., affected systems, encrypted files).

3. Collect evidence (e.g., logs, ransom note).

#### 3. Containment
##### * Short-Term Containment:

1. Isolate infected systems from the network.

2. Disable shared drives and remote access.

##### * Long-Term Containment:

1. Apply patches to vulnerable systems.

2. Update firewall rules to block malicious IPs.

#### 4. Eradication
##### * Remove Malware:

1. Use antivirus software to remove ransomware.

2. Rebuild infected systems from clean backups.

3. Eliminate Root Cause:

4. Identify and patch vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched software, weak passwords).

5. Disable compromised user accounts.

#### 5. Recovery
##### * Restore Systems:

1. Restore encrypted files from backups.

2. Verify the integrity of restored files.

##### * Monitor for Recurrence:

1. Continuously monitor systems for signs of reinfection.

2. Conduct a full system scan.

#### 6. Post-Incident Activity
##### * Lessons Learned:

1. Conduct a post-incident review with the response team.

2. Identify gaps in the response process.

##### * Improvements:

1. Update the incident response plan based on lessons learned.

2. Implement additional security measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication, regular backups).

## Step 3: Format the Playbook
