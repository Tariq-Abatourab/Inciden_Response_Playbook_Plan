#Incident Response Playbook Plan

This playbook will cover the following phases of incident response:

Preparation: Steps to prepare for potential incidents.

Detection and Analysis: How to detect and analyze the incident.

Containment: Steps to contain the incident and prevent further damage.

Eradication: How to eliminate the root cause of the incident.

Recovery: Steps to restore normal operations.

Post-Incident Activity: Lessons learned and improvements.

Step 1: Define the Hypothetical Scenario
Let’s assume the following scenario:

Attack Type: Ransomware attack.

Target: A small business network.

Impact: Critical files encrypted, systems offline, and ransom demand.

Step 2: Create the Incident Response Playbook
Here’s the detailed playbook for the ransomware attack:

1. Preparation
Team Roles and Responsibilities:

Incident Manager: Oversees the response process.

IT Team: Handles technical containment and recovery.

Legal Team: Advises on compliance and legal implications.

PR Team: Manages communication with stakeholders.

Tools and Resources:

Antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

Backup systems and disaster recovery plans.

Contact list for law enforcement and cybersecurity experts.

Training and Drills:

Conduct regular incident response drills.

Train employees on ransomware awareness.

2. Detection and Analysis
Detection:

Monitor for unusual activity (e.g., file encryption, ransom notes).

Use IDS and antivirus software to detect ransomware.

Analysis:

Identify the ransomware variant (e.g., WannaCry, LockBit).

Determine the scope of the attack (e.g., affected systems, encrypted files).

Collect evidence (e.g., logs, ransom note).

3. Containment
Short-Term Containment:

Isolate infected systems from the network.

Disable shared drives and remote access.

Long-Term Containment:

Apply patches to vulnerable systems.

Update firewall rules to block malicious IPs.

4. Eradication
Remove Malware:

Use antivirus software to remove ransomware.

Rebuild infected systems from clean backups.

Eliminate Root Cause:

Identify and patch vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched software, weak passwords).

Disable compromised user accounts.

5. Recovery
Restore Systems:

Restore encrypted files from backups.

Verify the integrity of restored files.

Monitor for Recurrence:

Continuously monitor systems for signs of reinfection.

Conduct a full system scan.

6. Post-Incident Activity
Lessons Learned:

Conduct a post-incident review with the response team.

Identify gaps in the response process.

Improvements:

Update the incident response plan based on lessons learned.

Implement additional security measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication, regular backups).

Step 3: Format the Playbook
